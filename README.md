Small Bundles
=============

This are the small bundle applications I publish in my blog http://www.ricardclau.com, under the Symfony2 category, available to download by everyone

1) LittlewebBundle
-------------------------

With this small bundle application I will show how to create a small web page using **Symfony2**.
I will use **annotations in routes** defined in controllers and **YML for translations**. **Twig** will be used as templating engine.

* First chapter covers: translations and routing
